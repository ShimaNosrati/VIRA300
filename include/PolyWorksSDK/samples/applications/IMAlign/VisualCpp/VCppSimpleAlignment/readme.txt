This application launches a series of commands to read a group of pif
files into IMAlign and align them.

The PifGroup_Tool directory found in the goodies\PolyWorksSDK\samples\data
directory contains appropriate pif files.

The *.h and *.c files needed for compiling this sample can be found
in the goodies\PolyWorksSDK\include\PolyWorksSDK\COM directory.

For more details, please refer to section 1, "Developing External Modules", of the
PolyWorks SDK Reference Guide in the documentation directory.

This sample code was developed and tested with 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and 2017.

Changes note:

If you built your own application based on an earlier version of this framework, we recommend that you use
a file differences tracking tool (such as WinDiff or Araxis Merge) to compare the content of this version
of the framework with the content of the framework you used to build you application. This way, you'll better
be able to see what part of the code was changed and decide whether you want to apply similar changes to
your own application.
