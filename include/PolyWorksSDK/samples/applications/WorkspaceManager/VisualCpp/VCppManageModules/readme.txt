This application demonstrates how to interact with the Workspace Manager and its 
modules. The application shows how to run a command, how to start a new module,
how to get a list of the already running modules and how to get an access to a
specific module using its project name.

The *.h and *.c files needed for compiling this sample can be found
in the goodies\PolyWorksSDK\include\PolyWorksSDK\COM directory.

For more details, please refer to section 1, "Developing External Modules", of the
PolyWorks SDK Reference Guide in the documentation directory.

This sample code was developed and tested with 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and 2017.

Changes note:

If you built your own application based on an earlier version of this framework, we recommend that you use
a file differences tracking tool (such as WinDiff or Araxis Merge) to compare the content of this version
of the framework with the content of the framework you used to build you application. This way, you'll better
be able to see what part of the code was changed and decide whether you want to apply similar changes to
your own application.
