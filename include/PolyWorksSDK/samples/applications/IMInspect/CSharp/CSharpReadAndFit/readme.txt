This application reads an ASCII file of a point cloud containing
points with coordinates and normals. The points are sent to
PolyWorks|Inspector, and a sphere is then fitted to them.

Each line of the ASCII file should have the following format:
X Y Z I J K

The file sphere.asc found in the goodies\PolyWorksSDK\samples\data
directory is one such file.

For more details, please refer to section 1, "Developing External Modules", of the
PolyWorks SDK Reference Guide in the documentation directory.

This sample code was developed and tested with
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and 2017.

Changes note:

If you built your own application based on an earlier version of this framework, we recommend that you use
a file differences tracking tool (such as WinDiff or Araxis Merge) to compare the content of this version
of the framework with the content of the framework you used to build you application. This way, you'll better
be able to see what part of the code was changed and decide whether you want to apply similar changes to
your own application.

Changes in V2021 IR4:

Added functions (ValueStrGetFromApp, ValueStrArrayGetFromApp) to retrieve string values from the application, using a command.

Changes in V2019:

Added Visual C# 2017 support by including .csproj project file.
Visual C# 2013 support is still available through .csproj project file, warnings might appear.
