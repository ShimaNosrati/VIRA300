Steps to create a new Rotary table plug-in for PolyWorks 2022 using the Visual C++ Rotary Table Framework

1- Change the strings "CompanyName" and "COMPANYNAME" by the name of your company everywhere
   (including all files (*.*) and the file names)

2- In the .rc file, change the values for the "FileDescription" and "ProductName" fields to a more appropriate name,
   such as "CompanyName Rotary Table"

3- In the .idl and .rgs files, replace each of the following UUIDs by new UUIDs generated
   by either uuidgen.exe or guidgen.exe:
    4E920F64-B8E2-4447-A0CF-820C17777A08
    EE37024F-2F57-4B30-894A-8F0488737E3E
    F2903F3C-2F69-4D12-8B0D-95B27091678B

4- In Visual Studio, go in the "Project Properties", for All Configurations, in the C/C++ section, the General category,
   and change the "Additional include directories" option to use the right path to the SDK's include directory.

5- Search for TODO comments and complete the code with the instructions given there
   (don't forget to change the include path for the IIMPlugin.tlb in the idl file)

6- Once the dll is compiled, copy it to the plugins directory of your Polyworks installation.
   Ex: C:\Program Files\InnovMetric\PolyWorks MS 2022\plugins
   Then, run as administrator the RegisterIMCOMServers.bat file found in the \bin directory of the
   Polyworks installation to register the plug-in (this registration needs to be done only once.)

7- Start the Workspace Manager, look for your plug-in's name in the Tools > Options > Plug-ins section,
   select it, then click OK to close the Options window.

8- To check if your plug-in is correctly loaded by PolyWorks|Inspector (it's the only application that supports rotary table plug-ins),
   check that it appears in the list of rotary tables in the Devices toolbar (showing the name returned by RotaryTableNameGet).

Note that it is a good practice to change the UUIDs and re-register your plug-in each time you make significant 
changes to your plug-in. On systems with multiple versions of PolyWorks installed concurrently, this is particularly
important to make sure that each version runs the plug-in located in its own plugins directory.

Changes note:

If you built your own plug-in based on an earlier version of this framework, we recommend that you use
a file differences tracking tool (such as WinDiff or Araxis Merge) to compare the content of this version
of the framework with the content of the framework you used to build you plug-in. This way, you'll better
be able to see what part of the code was changed and decide whether you want to apply similar changes to
your own plug-in.

Changes in V2022 IR3:

The application no longer calls the method IIMPlugin::PlgVersionGet to obtain a plug-in's version.
This method is obsolete and should not be used anymore.

Changes in V2021 IR9:

Added files for the CComInitRAII class. This class wraps calls to CoInitializeEx and CoUninitialize.

Changes in V2021 IR1:

Replacement of raw pointers with CComPtr.
Code updated to use nullptr instead of NULL when possible for type safety.
