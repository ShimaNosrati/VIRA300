Steps to create a plug-in for PolyWorks 2022 using Visual C#

1- Change the strings "CompanyName", "COMPANY_NAME" and "COMPANYNAME" by the name of your company everywhere
   (including all files (*.*) and the file names)

2- In the C[CompanyName]ComPlugin.cs file, replace the following UUID by a new UUID generated
   by either uuidgen.exe or guidgen.exe:
    3E3F6D14-53FC-46F7-A134-C6D55143EE35

3- Search for TODO comments and complete the code with the instructions given there

4- Once the dll is compiled, copy it to the plugins directory of your Polyworks installation.
   Ex: C:\Program Files\InnovMetric\PolyWorks MS 2022\plugins
   Then, run as administrator the RegisterIMCOMServers.bat file found in the \bin directory of the
   Polyworks installation to register the plug-in (this registration needs to be done only once.)

5- Start the Workspace Manager, look for your plug-in's name in the Tools > Options > Plug-ins section,
   select it, then click OK to close the Options window.

6- To check if your plug-in is correctly loaded by PolyWorks|Inspector, check that it appears
   under the Tools > Plug-ins menu.

Note that it is a good practice to change the UUIDs and re-register your plug-in each time you make significant 
changes to your plug-in. On systems with multiple versions of PolyWorks installed concurrently, this is particularly
important to make sure that each version runs the plug-in located in its own plugins directory.

Changes note:

If you built your own plug-in based on an earlier version of this framework, we recommend that you use
a file differences tracking tool (such as WinDiff or Araxis Merge) to compare the content of this version
of the framework with the content of the framework you used to build you plug-in. This way, you'll better
be able to see what part of the code was changed and decide whether you want to apply similar changes to
your own plug-in.
